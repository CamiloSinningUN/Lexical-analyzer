## Use üöÄ

Steps for the compilation and execution of the program:

1. It goes to project folder

2. The command is executed: lex -o LAB01_Caicedo_Julio_Sinning.c LAB01_Caicedo_Julio_Sinning.l (This generates the file LAB01_Caicedo_Julio_Sinning.c)

3. The command is executed: gcc -o LAB01_Caicedo_Julio_Sinning.out LAB01_Caicedo_Julio_Sinning.c (This generates the executable file LAB01_Caicedo_Julio_Sinning)

4. The command is executed: ./LAB01_Caicedo_Julio_Sinning.out Test.txt (This executes the program)

Finally, through the preference file reading mode, the results are seen in Salida.txt
